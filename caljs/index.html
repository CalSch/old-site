		<h1>Cal.js</h1>
		<p>Cal.js is my own JavaScript library. It's just a bunch of functions that make things easier and other stuff mashed together.</p>

		<h3>Show/Hide:</h3>
		<p>Show/Hide is a thing I made where you can have hidden text like this: <span class="show-hide">This is hidden by default</span>. If you want to have this in your website, make sure the <code>showHideEnabled</code> variable is set to <code>true</code> in Cal.js, for anything you want to hide just add <code>show-hide</code> to the class list of the element.</p>

		<h3><code>collToList()</code>:</h3>
		<p><code>collToList()</code> is a function that takes in an HTMLCollection object and gives out a list of all the elements inside it.</p>

		<h3><code>CustomElement()</code>:</h3>
		<p><code>CustomElement()</code> is a function that lets you make custom elements, you give it the tag name (a string), the attributes (a list), and a function. Example: <span class="show-hide">if you wanted a custom element called <code>repeat</code>, and there was an attribute called <code>times</code>, and it would reapeat the text in it that many times, the function would be this: <code>
CustomElement("repeat",["times"], function(element,args){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;element.innerHTML=element.innerHTML.repeat(args.times);<br>
});
		</code></span></p>
